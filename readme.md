## project euler solutions

- No attempt was made at documenting approaches or good code style, may change in the future :)
- uses [ilanschnell/bitarray](https://github.com/ilanschnell/bitarray) for extremely fast bitmaps for storing many primes
- i locally used [Pypy](https://www.pypy.org/download.html#python-3-6-compatible-pypy3-6-v7-3-0) to accelerate some local runs, although Python3 works fine as well
